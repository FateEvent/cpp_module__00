# cpp_modules

I'll list here the resources that, in addition to the official C++ documentation, constituted by

* <https://cplusplus.com>;
* <https://en.cppreference.com>;

and the two useful and interesting courses offered by OpenClassrooms:

* <https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1894236-apprenez-a-programmer-en-c>;
* <https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/7137751-programmez-en-oriente-objet-avec-c>;

may be useful to understand the concepts that are dealt with in the modules.
